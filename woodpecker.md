The red-cockaded woodpecker (Leuconotopicus borealis) is a woodpecker found in southeastern North America. Some taxonomic authorities, including the American Ornithological Society, continue to place this species in the genus Picoides. The red-cockaded woodpecker is small to mid-sized species, being intermediate in size between North America's two most widespread woodpeckers (the downy and hairy woodpeckers). The red-cockaded woodpecker's most distinguishing feature is a black cap and nape that encircle large white cheek patches. Rarely visible, except perhaps during the breeding season and periods of territorial defense, the male has a small red streak on each side of its black cap called a cockade, hence its name.
