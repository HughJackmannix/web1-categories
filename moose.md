The eastern moose (Alces alces americana) is a subspecies of moose that modernly ranges throughout Eastern Canada, New England and northern New York. It inhabits boreal forests and mixed deciduous forests. It is the third largest North American subspecies, after the western moose and the Alaskan moose. Males are aggressive during mating season and will attack anything that provokes them.The eastern moose's range spans a broad swath of northeastern North America which are in New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador (native to Labrador, introduced to Gander Bay, NF in 1878 and to Howley, NF in 1904), Nova Scotia, Quebec, Eastern Ontario, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and northern New York.Eastern moose that roam in Cape Breton Highlands National Park are descended from the western moose that originated from Alberta's Elk Island National Park. The population and range of the eastern moose increased in the decades leading up to the early 2000s as reforestation increased habitat area, but in more recent years diseases and parasites, including winter tick and brainworm, have cut into the population. There are about 350,000 eastern moose, with about 75% of them mating every autumn and winter.
