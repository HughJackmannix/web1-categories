Additional common names for the eastern rat snake include black rat snake, pilot snake, pilot black snake,chicken snake; and in Florida, yellow rat snake and Everglades rat snake. Pantherophis alleghaniensis is found in the United States east of the Apalachicola River in Florida, east of the Chattahoochee River in Georgia, east of the Appalachian Mountains, north to southeastern New York and western Vermont, eastern Pennsylvania, Maryland, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, south to the Florida Keys. In the Florida Panhandle, it readily hybridizes with the gray rat snake (Pantherophis spiloides). Adult snakes commonly measure 91.4 to 183 cm (36.0 to 72.0 in) in total length (including tail), with a few exceeding 200 cm (79 in).The longest recorded total length to date is 256.5 cm (101.0 in).

Adults are shiny black dorsally, with a cream or white chin and throat. The belly has an irregular black and white checkerboard pattern, becoming uniformly slate gray towards the tail. Juveniles have dark dorsal blotches on a grayish ground color. The ventral pattern in juveniles is the same as in adults. The eyes are round with a black pupil, and particularly in juveniles but not always present in adults, a distinct white margin.

The dorsal scales are weakly keeled, and are arranged in 23 to 27 rows at midbody.

Males and females have the same coloration. Males have proportionally longer tails (16-19% of total body length) compared to females (14–18% of total body length).
