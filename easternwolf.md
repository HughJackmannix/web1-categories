The eastern wolf (Canis lupus lycaon) is a subspecies of gray wolf native to the Great Lakes region and southeastern Canada. The subspecies is the product of ancient genetic admixture between the gray wolf and the coyote, however it is regarded as unique and therefore worthy of conservation. There are two forms, the larger being referred to as the Great Lakes wolf and the smaller being the Algonquin wolf. The eastern wolf's morphology is midway between that of the northwestern wolf and the coyote. The fur is typically of a grizzled grayish-brown color mixed with cinnamon. The nape, shoulder and tail region are a mix of black and gray, with the flanks and chest being rufous or creamy. It primarily preys on white-tailed deer, but may occasionally attack moose and beavers.
